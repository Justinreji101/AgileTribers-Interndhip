        <p>The startup ecosystem of Cyprus is a promising one, and the 2023 European Innovation Scoreboard recognizes Cyprus as a strong innovation focused nation, with over 446 startups valued at 3.7 billion Euros in 2022. To further promote the ecosystem, Reflect Festival, an annual event is held in Limassol, Cyprus, and is considered one of the largest tech gatherings in the region. It focuses on fostering new projects, promoting collaborations among startups, and encouraging productive partnerships. The festival also features speakers from around the world, providing a global perspective to its audience. Reflect began in 2018 and earlier this year, Reflect Festival 2023 was organised from 20th to 21st September in Limassol, Cyprus and brought together industry leaders, innovators, and entrepreneurs from across the globe. India was the country partner for the festival which saw participation from global stakeholders and entrepreneurs from various sectors.</p> 
        <p>Startup India took a delegation comprising of 8 Indian unique startups across various sectors showcased India's remarkable technological prowess and entrepreneurial spirit.
